Tl;DR: project with telegram bot and searching script. When script finds availability of medicament in pharmacy it sends a message to registered users.

This project was written two years ago.
It has disgusting code style. Also as logic. Shame on me.
Fortunately, since that time quality of my code has improved a lot, but I don't see the point to rewrite this.

A little bit of explanation.
A member of family needs some specific rare meds with a prescription that doesn't allow to buy more than one in one time. At one moment we found shortrage of this med in our city. So i wrote this script for finding and notification.
Hopefully, that was the only time when this project was used.
